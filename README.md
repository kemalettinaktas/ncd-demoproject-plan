## 1) What will the project do for the user? 
## Users can prepare a single question, a quiz or questionnare 
### Users can ask public questions for other users. If you want to ask a question for people, you should write a question text and multiple options and give point value for true answer.
### Users can answer the public questions. If you give a true answer to a question, you give its point and the question will be passive mode.
### The score table, question infos, and user infos will be saved to the blockchain.

## 2) How are you using the features of NEAR Protocol?
## I am using Persistent Storages, context information on NEAR, and multiple users can use the smart contract, so someone will ask a question and another user can answer it to collect points.
